A little investigation into drawing bezier curves, [this description was really helpful](https://javascript.info/bezier-curve)

Tap/click a point to toggle moving it its a little buggy looking but it should work fine

I used De Casteljau's Algorithm for this, the tl;dr is:
 - Pick n control points
 - Connect these control points with lines
 - Lerp a point across each of these lines to give you n-1 lines along the paths of these points
 - Lerp points across those lines
 - Do this iteratively until you end up with 1 point, the line this point traces is your curve
