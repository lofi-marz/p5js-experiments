title: Polygon Morph
description: Interpolating between polygons
---

This was a simple exercise in interpolation. We define a circle with a certain resolution,
and a function f(theta) which gives us the position for a certain angle, depending on the number of sides the shape should have.\
Then we pick a random polygon, and interpolate to that shape.\
For some flair, I've added a rotation animation between each shape, as well as making each shape interpolate to a circle in between.
